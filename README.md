# Walk the Plank Hangman Game

## Overview

Created during Week 2 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a hangman game that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML powered by JavaScript. 

## Utilizing the App

* View the app: [Github Pages Project Link](https://nicolelcarvalho.github.io/Hangman-Game/)

* Blank spaces are displayed on the screen to let the player know how many letters are in the word. 
* The words follow the pirate theme. 
* The player must type a letter in order to place their guess. 
* If the player is correct, the respective blank is replaced by the letter guessed.
* If the player is incorrect, the pirate and captain take a step on the plank. The player is alotted 9 steps on the plank.
* The incorrect letter that was guessed is also appended to the screen under "Letters Guessed" to let the player know what they have already guessed. 
* If the player guesses all of the letters before their 9 steps are used, they get a win and the game resets displaying a new word. If not, they get a loss and the game resets displaying a new word.
